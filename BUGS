 o Mountpoints and fs options for encrypted partitions are not remembered
   when partman restarts.

 o Options like mountpoint are not removed when method changes to swap.
   This makes it impossible for the user to correct /-on-crypto or /boot-
   on-crypto errors.

 o Partition erase eats too much memory and causes OOM. Might be a kernel
   problem with loop-AES. Just dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop0 bs=4k on 
   encrypted loop reproducible triggers it (64mb system). There is a big 
   increase of bio and biovec-1 in slabinfo just before OOM. Maybe related
   to bio OOM problems some people reported on lkml (fixed after 2.6.15)?

   Perhaps it's not caused by loop-AES: dd to /dev/hda1 in low memory
   conditions can sometimes also trigger OOM. Can't be scsi_cmd leak as
   the problem also shows with IDE. skbuff_head_cache looks normal.

     There remain some box-killing bugs:
     - The scsi_cmd leak
     - The BIO-uses-ZONE_DMA-hence-oom-killing bug
     - A skbuff_head_cache leak causes oom-killings.
