 IMPORTANT:
   This code is still pre-beta and has not been audited for flaws that
   could introduce weaknesses in the encryption. Please don't use it for
   any confidential data before the beta release.

The scripts do stuff more or less in the following order:

 1. init.d/crypto_modules
 2. choose_method/crypto
 3. active_partition/*
 4. choose_partition/crypto
 5. init.d/crypto
 6. blockdev-keygen
 7. update.d/crypto_visuals
 8. finish.d/check_randomfskey, aptinstall_crypto, fstab_loop

init.d/
  crypto_modules

    Loads kernel modules required for loop-AES ("loop-aes.ko") and
    required for dm-crypt (TODO).
  
choose_method/
  crypto

    Entry in the "Use as:" menu. All encryption types (loop-AES,
    dm-crypt) are merged into one choice. Writes "crypto"
    into $dev/$id/method and activates the below crypto options.

active_partition/*

    Entries in the partition menu. Which are shown depends on crypt_type
    and cipher. loop-AES shows no keysize option because it's ciphers have
    fixed keysizes. The chosen values are stored in $dev/$id/<entry>

choose_partition/
  crypto

    "Setup encrypted volumes" in the main menu. Checks for valid cipher
    options and safe swap. Creates keyfiles, erases to-be-encrypted
    parititons and finally does losetup/dmsetup.

init.d/
  crypto

    Creates the partman cryptdisks once for each crypto partition.
  
update.d/
  crypto_visuals

    Shows "crypt" in the method column, and the name of the crypt disk as 
    mountpoint, so the user can see which loop/dm device is which after
    they have been setup.

finish.d/
  check_randomfskey

    Shows a warning if user chose to create a filesystem on a crypt disk
    with keytype random. User can force to continue, maybe that should 
    eventually be disabled. Note: random keytype can make sense for the
    /tmp partition, but actually requires random/1777 keytype.
   
finish.d/
  fstab_loop
    
    Replaces loop devices in fstab with corresponding real devices and 
    adds crypto mount options. This is a bit of a hack used because we 
    can't use get_mountoptions from partman. Crypto settings are stored 
    in dev/$id of cleartext partition, but everything else is stored in
    the crypt_device dev/$id. We want the mount options, finish.d checks,
    etc. handled by whatever feels responsible for what should be store
    d on the encrypted partition, so this seems necessary.

finish.d/
  aptinstall_crypto

    Installs userspace tools and helper packages for encryption. This 
    is responsible for installing loop-aes-utils and loop-aes-rootfs (TODO)
    into the target system. Similarily for dm-crypt, installs cryptsetup 
    etc.

blockdev-keygen
   
    Asks for a passphrase, confirms that it has been entered correctly 
    and optionally tests for a minimum length. If the name for a keyfile
    is specified as third argument it creates a gnupg keyfile for use
    with loop-AES, otherwise it just echoes the pass to stdout. 
    
    The actual encryption keys for loop-AES keyfiles are generated from
    /dev/random, so we need plenty of entropy. This script uses the 
    cdebconf plugin "entropy" if available. See notes at the beginning
    of the script for important steps for the caller.

crypto_modules

    Run by prebaseconfig.d hook; Checks for loop-AES partitions,
    determines target kernel version from base-installer/kernel/image
    and installs a corresponding loop-aes-$KVERS package into /target.

ciphers/$crypt_type/$cipher

    Lists supported ciphers for each crypt_type. The following files
    exist for each cipher directory. They are used to display a short
    description of the cipher for the user and to determine allowed 
    crypto parameters (TODO):

    - desc (description)
    - options (crypt_type specific)

    Structure is
      ciphers/$crypt_type/$cipher/<file>
  
mountoptions
mountoptions/crypto

    Should be no longer required. Maybe resurrect once we find a cleaner
    approach for setting crypto-specific mount options.
