 
  o do the tests in choose_partition/crypto/do_option cover all
    cases where unencrypted swap may be setup?
  
  o need better sources of entropy. check if we could load and use
    hw_random, sound, .. ?
  
  o understand and add undo.d stuff
  
  o set fs_passno for loop entries in fstab to 0; currently fsck
    spews ugly warnings because it tries to fsck the unencrypted
    backing device. who will do the fsck then?

  o maybe we could reduce the number of steps requires by
    assuming default cipher and keytype when the crypt_type
    is first chosen

  o also, maybe we could set the default choice of "use as"
    to swap for crypt disks with random keytype. Maybe even
    create a swap partition in there by default?
  
  o allow use of existing keyfiles. How can we access removable
    media while partman is running ? Interesting media would be
    floppy, USB media, perhaps others.

  o allow to create and store keyfiles on removable media. Same
    questions as above. Using it should simply be a matter of 
    writing the path into $id/keyfile and echoing the passphrase
    into the pass fifo.
 
  o upload loop-aes-rootfs (for mkinitrd)
    - what about initramfs-tools?
    - what about yaird?

  o partman-auto-crypto

  o dm-crypt
  o dm-crypt-luks
  - those need seperate keysize, hashfunc questions?
  - how are keys stored? are they stored?
