IMPORTANT (must be solved before beta)
--------------------------------------

  [ All ]
  o Check that the tests in choose_partition/crypto/do_option cover 
    all cases in which unencrypted swap may be setup.

  [ loop-AES ]
  o Find better sources of entropy. Check if we could load and use
    hw_random, sound, .. ?
  
GENERAL
-------

  [ All ]
  o Make it possible to de-allocate (losetup -d, cryptsetup ..)
    encrypted partitions.
 
  o Understand and add undo.d scripts if required
 
FEATURES
--------

  [ All ]
  o Allow use of existing keyfiles. How can we access removable
    media while partman is running ? Interesting media would be
    floppy, USB media, perhaps others.

  o Allow to create and store keyfiles on removable media. Same
    questions as above. Using it should simply be a matter of 
    writing the path into $id/keyfile and echoing the passphrase
    into the pass fifo.
 
  [ loop-AES ]
  o Support for encrypted root partitions. There is a package 
    loop-aes-rootfs for (obsolete) mkinitrd-tools.

  o Add support to partman-auto-crypto
