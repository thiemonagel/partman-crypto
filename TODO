IMPORTANT (must be solved before beta)
--------------------------------------
 
  o Check that the tests in choose_partition/crypto/do_option cover 
    all cases in which unencrypted swap may be setup.
  
  o Find better sources of entropy. Check if we could load and use
    hw_random, sound, .. ?
  
  o Arrange fsck for loop-AES encrypted partitions. The normal 
    mechanism doesn't work since it tries to fsck the encrypted
    backing device. Two options:

    1 Set fs_passno to 0 to prevent automatic fsck. After loops
      have been mounted, remount read-only, fsck, remount r/w in
      an init script. Downsides: May mount unchecked filesystems.
      Upsides: Matches upstream setup instructions.

    2 Install an init script to losetup and fsck loops before 
      S35mountall.sh; List loop devices as devices in /etc/fstab
      rather than as loop= option. Downsides: Needs extra looptab
      or something, diverges from upstream. Upsides: fsck before
      mount, no fstab hacking required in finish.d/fstab_loop.
      Could cryptsetup be used?

GENERAL
-------
  
  o Understand and add undo.d scripts if required
  
FEATURES
--------

  o Allow use of existing keyfiles. How can we access removable
    media while partman is running ? Interesting media would be
    floppy, USB media, perhaps others.

  o Allow to create and store keyfiles on removable media. Same
    questions as above. Using it should simply be a matter of 
    writing the path into $id/keyfile and echoing the passphrase
    into the pass fifo.
 
  o Support for encrypted root partitions. There is a package 
    loop-aes-rootfs for (obsolete) mkinitrd-tools.
    - TODO: initramfs-tools
    - TODO: yaird

  o partman-auto-crypto

  o Support for plain dm-crypt and LUKS
    - Needs seperate keysize, hashfunc questions?
    - Which type of keys should we use for dm-crypt? Wesley said 
      that hashed passphrases are not very good. Can we use some
      kind of keyfiles instead?
