IMPORTANT (must be solved before beta)
--------------------------------------
 
  o Check that the tests in choose_partition/crypto/do_option cover 
    all cases in which unencrypted swap may be setup.
  
  o Find better sources of entropy. Check if we could load and use
    hw_random, sound, .. ?
  
  o Set fs_passno for loop entries in fstab to 0; Currently fsck
    spews ugly warnings because it tries to fsck the unencrypted
    backing device. Who will do the fsck then?

GENERAL
-------
  
  o Understand and add undo.d scripts if required
  
USABILITY
---------
  
  o Perhaps we could set the default choice of "use as" to 
    swap for crypt disks with random keytype. Maybe even
    create a swap partition in there by default?
  
FEATURES
--------

  o Allow use of existing keyfiles. How can we access removable
    media while partman is running ? Interesting media would be
    floppy, USB media, perhaps others.

  o Allow to create and store keyfiles on removable media. Same
    questions as above. Using it should simply be a matter of 
    writing the path into $id/keyfile and echoing the passphrase
    into the pass fifo.
 
  o Support for encrypted root partitions. There is a package 
    loop-aes-rootfs for (obsolete) mkinitrd-tools.
    - TODO: initramfs-tools
    - TODO: yaird

  o partman-auto-crypto

  o Support for dm-crypt
    - Needs seperate keysize, hashfunc questions?
    - Which type of keys should we use for dm-crypt? Wesley said 
      that hashed passphrases are not very good. Can we use some
      kind of keyfiles instead?

  o Support for LUKS
    - Required packages not yet in Debian (cryptsetup-luks)
