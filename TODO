 
  o check if we could load and use hw_random
  
  o if "setup encrypted storage" (or LVM?) is called after an
    encrypted partition has been setup, the partition disappears.
    What's happening there? 
  
  o understand and add undo.d stuff
  
  o maybe we could reduce the number of steps requires by
    assuming default cipher and keytype when the crypt_ype
    is first chosen

  o also, maybe we could set the default choice of "use as"
    to swap for crypt disks with random keytype. Maybe even
    create a swap partition in there by default?
  
  o allow use of existing keyfiles. How can we access removable
    media while partman is running ? Interesting media would be
    floppy, USB media, perhaps others.

  o allow to create and store keyfiles on removable media. Same
    questions as above. Using it should simply be a matter of 
    writing the path into $id/keyfile and echoing the passphrase
    into the pass fifo. (XX needs passphrase questions outside
    of loop-aes-keygen)
 
  o provide options "Erase partition", "Erase disk"
  o erase crypt partitions by default?
  o use aespipe-udeb or losetup/dd?

  o upload loop-aes-modules (in NEW)
  o upload loop-aes-rootfs (for mkinitrd)
    - what about initramfs-tools?
    - what about yaird?

  o partman-auto-crypto

  o dm-crypt
  o dm-crypt-luks
  - those need seperate keysize, hashfunc questions?
  - how are keys stored? are they stored?
