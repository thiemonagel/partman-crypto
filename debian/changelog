partman-crypto (1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Max Vozeler ]
  * First version

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use 'rm -f' rather than more awkward test-then-remove constructions.
  * Use stop_parted_server and restart_partman functions from partman-base
    73 instead of duplicating the code.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Correct a typo in templates (s/systems tries/system tries)
  * Correct wording of "e.g."
  * Correct one templates paragraph so that it's identical to another
    one. Thanks to Jens Seidel for noticing all these
