partman-crypto (9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Max Vozeler ]
  * blockdev-wipe: Open the device with O_SYNC to avoid
    out-of-memory situations during partition erase, which appear
    to be caused by overcommit and a large number of queued
    requests. As a side-effect this helps to provide accurate
    information in the progressbar. Closes: #381135

  * blockdev-wipe: To compensate for the performance impact
    of O_SYNC increase blocksize from 4k to 64k.

  * crypto_tools.sh: Use 128 bit (instead of 256 bit) 
    random key when setting up dm-crypt for partition erase.
    This should speed up erase a bit. Also take the key from
    /dev/urandom so we don't risk a blocking read.
