  * For hd-media installs the module loop will already be loaded, which
    prevents loop-aes from being loaded. Attempt to replace loop with loop-aes
    by unmounting the CD image, replacing the module and remounting the image.
    As losetup is not available, we cannot check what exactly is loop-mounted,
    so we just assume that loop is only used for a CD image.
