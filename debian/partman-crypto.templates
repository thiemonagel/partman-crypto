Description: Are you sure you want to erase the data on ${DEVICE}?
 The data on ${DEVICE} will be overwritten with random data. It can no
 longer be recovered after this step has completed. This is the last 
 opportunity to abort the erase.

Template: partman-crypto/module_package_missing
Type: error
_Description: Encryption package installation failure
 The kernel module package ${PACKAGE} could not be found or an error
 occurred during installation.
 .
 There will likely be problems during boot when the system tries to
 setup encrypted partitions. You can still correct them by installing the
 required package later on.

Template: partman-crypto/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Write the changes to disks and configure encrypted volumes?
 Before encrypted volumes can be configured, the current
 partitioning scheme has to be written to disk.  These changes
 cannot be undone.
 .
 After the encrypted volumes have been configured, no additional
 changes to the partitions in the disks containing encrypted volumes
 are allowed. Please decide if you are satisfied with the current
 partitioning scheme in these disks before continuing.

Template: partman-crypto/unsafe_swap
Type: error
_Description: Unsafe swap space detected
 An unsafe swap space has been detected.
 .
 This is a fatal error since sensitive data could be written out to
 disk unencrypted. This would allow someone with access to the disk to
 recover parts of the encryption key or passphrase.
 .
 Please disable the swap space (e.g. by running swapoff) or configure
 an encrypted swap space and then run setup of encrypted volumes again.
 This program will now abort.

Template: partman-crypto/passphrase
Type: password
_Description: Encryption passphrase:
 You need to choose a passphrase to encrypt ${DEVICE}.
 .
 The overall strength of the encryption depends strongly on this
 passphrase, so you should take care to choose a passphrase that is
 not easy to guess. It should not be a word or sentence found in
 dictionaries, or a phrase that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good passphrase will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and
 punctuation. Passphrases are recommended to have a length of 20 or
 more characters.

_Description: Re-enter passphrase to verify:
 Please enter the same passphrase again to verify that you have typed it
 correctly.

_Description: Passphrase input error
 The two passphrases you entered were not the same. Please try again.

Template: partman-crypto/passphrase-empty

_Description: Empty passphrase
 You entered an empty passphrase, which is not allowed.
 Please choose a non-empty passphrase.

Template: partman-crypto/weak_passphrase
Type: boolean
Default: false
# Translators: we unfortunately cannot use plural forms here
# So, you are suggested to use the plural form adapted for
# MINIMUM=8, which is the current hardcoded value
_Description: Use weak passphrase?
 You entered a passphrase that consists of less than ${MINIMUM} characters,
 which is considered too weak. You should choose a stronger passphrase.

Template: partman-crypto/need_more_entropy
Type: string
_Description: Enter random characters to continue
 The encryption key for ${DEVICE} is now being created. (${PROGRESS})
 .
 This process requires the system to have large amounts of collected
 randomness ("entropy"), of which there is likely too little at this
 stage of the installation.
 .
 You can help speed up the process by entering random data on the
 keyboard to fill the randomness pool and continuing once in a while.
 This dialog will recur until enough keydata has been collected.

 The encryption key for ${DEVICE} is now being created.
 .
 This process requires the system to have large amounts of collected

 You can help speed up the process by entering random characters on
 the keyboard, or just wait until enough keydata has been collected.
 (NOTE: this can take a long time)

_Description: Keyfile creation failure
 An error occurred while creating the keyfile.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_root_unimplemented
Type: error
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the root filesystem to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This feature is not available and continuing now would
 result in an installation that cannot be used.
 .
 Please go back and choose a non-encrypted partition for the root
 filesystem.

Template: partman-crypto/use_random_for_nonswap
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Are you sure you want to use a random key?
 You have chosen a random key type for ${DEVICE} but requested the
 partitioner to create a filesystem on it.
 .
 Using a random key type means that the partition data is going to
 be destroyed upon each reboot. This should only be used for
 swap partitions.
