 Different algorithms exist to derive the initialization vector

 The encryption key is derived from the passphrase by applying a
 one-way hash function to it. Normally, there is no reason to change
 this from the recommended default and doing so in the wrong way
 can reduce the encryption strength.

 this by installing the required package(s) later on.

_Description: Write the changes to disk and configure encrypted volumes?
 Before encrypted volumes can be configured, the current
 partitioning scheme has to be written to disk.  These changes
 cannot be undone.

 After the encrypted volumes have been configured, no additional
 changes to the partitions on the disks containing encrypted volumes
 are allowed. Please decide if you are satisfied with the current
 partitioning scheme for these disks before continuing.

Template: partman-crypto/unsafe_swap
Type: error
_Description: Unsafe swap space detected
 An unsafe swap space has been detected.
 .
 This is a fatal error since sensitive data could be written out to
 disk unencrypted. This would allow someone with access to the disk to
 recover parts of the encryption key or passphrase.
 .
 Please disable the swap space (e.g. by running swapoff) or configure
 an encrypted swap space and then run setup of encrypted volumes again.
 This program will now abort.

Template: partman-crypto/passphrase
Type: password
_Description: Encryption passphrase:
 You need to choose a passphrase to encrypt ${DEVICE}.
 .
 The overall strength of the encryption depends strongly on this
 passphrase, so you should take care to choose a passphrase that is
 not easy to guess. It should not be a word or sentence found in
 dictionaries, or a phrase that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good passphrase will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and
 punctuation. Passphrases are recommended to have a length of 20 or
 more characters.

# Translators: we unfortunately cannot use plural forms here

_Description: Use weak passphrase?
 You entered a passphrase that consists of less than ${MINIMUM} characters,
 which is considered too weak. You should choose a stronger passphrase.

Template: partman-crypto/entropy-text

_Description: Enter random characters
 The encryption key for ${DEVICE} is now being created.

 You can help speed up the process by entering random characters on
 the keyboard, or just wait until enough keydata has been collected.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_root_unimplemented
Type: error
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the root file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This feature is not available and continuing now would
 result in an installation that cannot be used.
 .
 Please go back and choose a non-encrypted partition for the root
 file system.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_root_needs_boot
Type: error
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the root file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This feature requires a separate /boot partition on which
 the kernel and initrd can be stored.
 .
 You should go back and setup a /boot partition.

Template: partman-crypto/crypto_boot_not_possible
Type: error
_Description: Encryption configuration failure
 You have selected the /boot file system to be stored on an encrypted
 partition. This is not possible because the bootloader would be unable to
 load the kernel and initrd. Continuing now would result
 in an installation that cannot be used.
 .
 You should go back and choose a non-encrypted partition for the /boot
 file system.

Template: partman-crypto/use_random_for_nonswap
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Are you sure you want to use a random key?
 You have chosen a random key type for ${DEVICE} but requested the
 partitioner to create a file system on it.
 .
 Using a random key type means that the partition data is going to
 be destroyed upon each reboot. This should only be used for
 swap partitions.

Template: partman-crypto/warning_experimental_nonaudit
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Really use block device encryption?
 The support for block device encryption is still experimental and not
 considered ready for production. In particular it may result in setups
 that are easy to break and so give a false sense of security. There are
 no known encryption flaws, however, until the implementation is thoroughly
 audited, this feature should not be used except for testing purposes.
